Modes — `peaks in the distribution of features.`

Mode Collapse — `the generator gets stuck generating one mode.` 

Problem with BCE Loss (**vanishing gradient**) — `the discriminator does not output useful gradients (feedback) for the generator when the real/fake distributions are far apart.`

Earth Mover's Distance — `Earth mover’s distance is a measure of how different two distributions are by estimating the effort it takes to make the generated distribution equal to the real one`.
