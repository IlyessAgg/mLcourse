## About this Specialization

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors **diagnose patients** more accurately, make **predictions about patients’ future health**, and recommend better **treatments**. In this Specialization, you’ll gain practical experience applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine. You’ll learn how to:

- Diagnose diseases from x-rays and 3D MRI brain images
- Predict patient survival rates more accurately using tree-based models
- Estimate treatment effects on patients using data from randomized trials
- Automate the task of labeling medical datasets using natural language processing
