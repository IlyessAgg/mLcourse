## About this Course

Medical treatment may impact patients differently based on their existing health conditions. In this final course, you’ll estimate **treatment effects** using data from randomized control trials and applying tree-based models. In the second week, you’ll use natural language entity extraction and **question-answering methods** to automate the task of **labeling** medical datasets. In the final week of this course, you’ll apply machine learning **interpretation methods** to explain the decision-making of complex machine learning models.
